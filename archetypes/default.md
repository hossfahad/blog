Hi. I'm **Fahad**. 

I'm a Product Manager with a history of finding value across various industries, from health-tech to fin-tech. Previous software experience in front-end development so sometimes I'll write on that as well. 

If I find something cool in the world of Product Management, I'll write it down. Often times I may have others collaborate. I am also happy to review resumes, give career feedback and other general mentorship requests.
