As a Product Manager, organizing and managing tasks effectively are essential to the success of any project. With the increasing complexity of projects in the modern technology organization, JIRA has become a market leader in the world of productivity management and team collaboration.

Whether you are a large company or a growing organization, creating and prioritizing milestones, support tickets or visualizing project progress with interactive boards, JIRA provides a centralized platform to manage all aspects of the team's workflow. 

It's likely you know this and are probably using JIRA (hence why you're reading this), but from my experience, JIRA's robust functionalities are not always initially seen from the outside due to the layers of options embedded within each capability. **I've gotten better at finding the best use case for a couple features, and here are five:**

* * * * *

#### 1\. JIRA Automations

*JIRA Automations* is a powerful tool that can help you save time and increase productivity by automating repetitive tasks and processes. JIRA has made this quite easy with a drag-n-drop UI, essentially turning automation actions into *Lego* blocks. The best way to effectively leverage Automations vary based on the use case. But some common cases to always consider:

1.  **Identifying Repetitive Tasks:** If needing to upload a monthly report or podcast for your business, these are the best situations where JIRA Automation can simplify this process. For instance, when an issue is created, you can tag the work item as <*Support*>, or <*Upload*>, or assign it to a certain team member. 
2.  **Leveraging Automation Playground:** If you aren't certain on how to get started, take an action that is happening in your day to day and look into the [Automation Playground by Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/automation-template-library/rules#/rule-list?systemLabelId=all&page=1&pageSize=20&sortKey=name&sortOrder=ASC) for user created rules that may apply to your workflow.
3.  **Integrations**: JIRA Automations incorporate integrations with many of the leading software management tools from ServiceNow, GitHub, Figma and more. Depending on your organization's toolkit, starting with the services you use now may help in finding the right time-saving automation tools to add to your arsenal. I will dive into common integration scenarios a bit further down.

#### 2\. Components\
JIRA's Components feature allows users to containerize work items throughout the various project boards and workflows across your product's business line. For instance, our organization bundles any of the support tickets we receive from customers and *auto-assign* to a certain team member. Components allow you to assign lead owners of the component, allowing simple triaging when automating production bugs.

A couple other features worth noting in Components: 

1.  **Component Hierarchy**: JIRA now allows users to create hierarchical components. This means that components can now have parent and child components, allowing users to better organize their work with subcomponents. For example, you can bundle a *Customer Request* component into sub-components depending on the user's business line or persona.
2.  **Component Reporting**: This allows users to easily see the progress of each component, identify issues or roadblocks, and track overall progress more effectively.

#### 3\. The Art of JQL

[JQL](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/guides/jql/overview) is JIRA's querying language, allowing users to gain full customizability across your entire project's body. Working as the language across JIRA, leveraging JQL and mastering it's syntax can help align Roadmaps, Kanban boards, Filters, Components and anything else. The granularity of JQL allows you to expand across your single project's queries in a view I haven't seen being used in competing services like Azure's DevOps.

> project = Project1 OR project = Project2

This skillset easier dependency management, cross-functional team tracking (Engineering, Design, Product) and Roadmap views to ensure everyone's on the path to the finish line.

If you are familiar with SQL, JQL isn't much different. However, JIRA offers a **cheat sheet** that covers the fundamentals on building queries, which you can download [here](https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/atlassian-jql-cheat-sheet-2.pdf).\
4\. Integration Capabilities

As mentioned earlier on Automations, Integrations is probably one of the biggest pillars in a productivity toolbox, effectively acting as the glue between many serparated services dedicated to their own use case. You can get the full range of integrated services in the [JIRA Marketplace](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/#). My team has thought through several quick wins that have helped our productivity using the tools we leverage in our day to day:
